  <h1>Monstor Hunter World</h1>
  <p>Monster Hunter titles have always had a big following in Japan, but struggled in the U.S. due to grind-heavy gameplay
   and extremely complex RPG systems that do little to hold your hand. That said, Monster Hunter Worldâ€™s open beta was 
   encouraging, showing a game that promises co-op fun for you and up to three friends, but with the rough edges from previous 
   titles smoothed down, keeping the appealing core game loop alive: You gear up to hunt down some gargantuan bad guys, and then 
   loot their 
  corpses to fashion weapons and armor to hunt down even bigger and badder guys.</p>
  <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
