<h1>Description</h1>
<h2>Street Racing</h2>
<p>
Need for Speed: Most Wanted is the tenth installment of this popular series. It features gameplay that 
is oriented toward street racing in Rockport City. The name of the game is avoiding veteran police officer Sergeant Cross. To do this, you have to pull out all the stops, as well as deal with other street car racers like antagonist Clarence "Razor" Callahan who seems bent on sabotaging you and stealing your wheels.

<h2>Fast for its age</h2>
Need for Speed: Most Wanted has some great car options, as well as a high-paced plot most avid gamers will appreciate. The aspect of police pursuit is also an added bonus. Since this game is a few years old, some graphics purists might decry the imagery as a bit outdated. Compared to a lot of other games in its class that were made around the same time, Need for Speed: Most Wanted still has some pretty 
impressive and crisp graphic designs associated with it though. </p>
