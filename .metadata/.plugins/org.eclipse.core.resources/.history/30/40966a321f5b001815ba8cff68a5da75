It has come to our attention that the physical Baby Roshan reward for last yearâ€™s Battle Pass has had poor 
production quality yields. We apologize to our fans for that, it is well below the quality we expected. We are going to start
 from scratch on new production for the statue, and prioritize delivering it as soon as possible to every customer that reached 
 level 2000 last year.
