<h1>Description</h1>
<h2>Street Racing</h2>
<p>
The awkwardly named Project IGI: I'm Going In follows in the trend of the Rainbow Six series, the Delta
 Force series, and SWAT 3. It eschews the outlandish futuristic weapons and imaginary settings of many traditional 
 shooters and focuses instead on contemporary realism. In the game, you play as David Llewelyn Jones, a former Special Air
  Service member who now works as a freelance operative for both the British and American governments. The game features a blend of stealth, covert surveillance, and high-powered firefights at secret military bases, and it has much of the thrill and daring of the James Bond films 
of the late Cold War era. But it also has several significant shortcomings.
