  <h1>London</h1>
  <p>2017 was an annus mirabilis for video games. There was at least one game released (Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild) that will live on “Greatest Games of All Time” lists for a long time to come, and plenty more that will hold their top spots on Metacritic for the foreseeable future. You could easily spend 2018 just getting through the backlog of what you missed in 2017 and still only being playing really, really high-quality stuff. So it’s gonna be tough for 2018 to live up to all that.

But the new year still promises some extremely intriguing releases, including a new title from Grand Theft Auto 
publisher Rockstar and complete moonshots like the PS4’s “make your own game as you go” title Dreams. There’s a 100 percent 
chance some of the games below will get delayed — after all, we put Red Dead Redemption 2 on our 2017 Most Anticipated list.
 It shows up again here, and we’re pretty sure it’ll hit shelves this time around. The same can’t be said for all the 
 other titles, but here’s what we’re most 
looking forward to this year nevertheless..</p>
  <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
