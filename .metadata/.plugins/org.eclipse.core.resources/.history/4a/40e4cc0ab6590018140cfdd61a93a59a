  <h1>Monstor Hunter World</h1>
  <p>Monster Hunter titles have always had a big following in Japan, but struggled in the U.S. due to grind-heavy gameplay
   and extremely complex RPG systems that do little to hold your hand. That said, Monster Hunter Worldâ€™s open beta was 
   encouraging, showing a game that promises co-op fun for you and up to three friends, but with the rough edges from previous 
   titles smoothed down, keeping the appealing core game loop alive: You gear up to hunt down some gargantuan bad guys, and then 
   loot their 
  corpses to fashion weapons and armor to hunt down even bigger and badder guys.</p>
  <p>Monster Hunter: World received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising how Capcom was 
  able to make the game more accessible to new players and to Western markets, without detracting from the 
  series' core gameplay elements and enjoyable difficulty, and fully taking advantage of the computational capacity of 
  modern consoles to create living ecosystems. Within a few weeks of release, the game became the fastest-selling game in 
  Capcom's history, eventually becoming their 
  best-selling game with 7.9 million copies shipped by March 2018..</p>
